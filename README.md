### Abstract

Adding new purchase types to mature apps is risky business. When KKBOX needed to introduce a new in-app purchase model, we couldn't afford to disrupt existing users. This talk shares our real-world experience using StoreKit 2 for new features while keeping the original StoreKit API for legacy flows. Learn the technical gotchas, App Store review surprises, and practical strategies for payment system evolution in production apps. Perfect for developers facing similar legacy modernization challenges.

### Key Topics Covered

- StoreKit APIs Overview
- KKBOX Implementation Context
- Strategic Rationale
- Technical Implementation Challenges
- App Store Review Process Reality
